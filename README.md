# VLSI Physical Design for ASICs

 The objective of VLSI physical design for ASICs is to convert a logical RTL design into a physical layout suitable for fabrication. This process ensures the circuit's functionality aligns with design constraints, performance goals, and manufacturing standards. 

In the first class we learnt about introduction to riscv, the connection between apps and hardware  and the description of the course

# Day 2

We were introduced to Application Binary interface like a between an application and the hardware there operating system compiler Run time environment etc
THe application Programmer can directly access the registors by system calls
